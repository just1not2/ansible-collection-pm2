# PM2 Ansible Collection

The Parallel Multithreaded Machine (PM2) Ansible collection includes Ansible modules to help the management of PM2 processes.

This collection has been tested against following PM2 versions: **>=4.2.0**.


## Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.10.0**.

Plugins and modules within a collection may be tested with only specific Ansible versions.
A collection may contain metadata that identifies these versions.
PEP440 is the schema used to describe the versions of Ansible.

## Installing this collection

You can install the PM2 collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```


## Using this collection

You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `just1not2.pm2.pm2_facts`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `just1not2.pm2` collection in the playbook's collections keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Populate PM2 facts
    just1not2.pm2.pm2_facts:

  - name: Print the list of PM2 processes
    debug:
      var: ansible_facts.pm2.processes

  - name: Make sure PM2 example process is running
    just1not2.pm2.pm2_process:
      name: example
      file: /path/to/script.py
      state: started
```
